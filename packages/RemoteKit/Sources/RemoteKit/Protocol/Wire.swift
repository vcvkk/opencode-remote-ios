/// documented in docs/protocol-v1.md. The Mac adapter translates these to

///
/// Neither "on my Wi-Fi" nor "knows the address" is an identity — so every
/// connection is authenticated and encrypted with the key both devices
/// derived when they paired (see Pairing):
///
/// 1. server → client   plain `challenge` event carrying a fresh nonce
/// 2. client → server   plain `auth` frame: device name, its own nonce, and
///                      an HMAC over both nonces keyed by the channel key
/// 3. server → client   sealed `ready` event — being able to seal against
///                      the session key (which mixes both nonces) is the
///                      server's proof, so the phone never talks to an
///                      impostor advertising our Bonjour type
